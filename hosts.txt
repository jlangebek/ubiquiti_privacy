# Title: jlangebek/ubiquiti_privacy
#
# This hosts file is a collection of hosts that Unifi Dream Machine or related Unifi hardware (switches+access points)
# uses for "phoning home" to Ubiquiti in spite of opt-outs, etc. As Ubiquiti (to the best of my knowledge) has not disclosed
# detailed information on what is being collected, the lack of transparency means no privacy trust per default.
#
# It started after looking into this thread:
# https://community.ui.com/questions/86232-DNS-queries-to-static-ubnt-com-in-24hrs-Data-Collection-Where-is-the-OPT-OUT/63972679-034f-4a83-bc85-6664253e3cd8#answer/cbb7d497-9edd-4d6c-99cb-dd2e7ee1dd7f
#
# The hosts contained in this file are based on Pi-Hole logging on the latest version of Unifi software (controller, etc), and may be way too "tin-foil" hat for your purposes!
#
# Each section documents a number of addresses spotted by using UI hardware. The "Probably used for" and "Privacy view"
# describes in my laymans terms what these addresses are most probably used for (as there is no real central documentation
# of this, to the best of my knowledge), and "Privacy view" describes why this is blocked (ie. in this file).
